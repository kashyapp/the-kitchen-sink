guilt doesnt work
love works
sacrifice works
frustration doesnt help
taking frustration out on a wall doesnt help
breaking up works
i am fucked
totally
literally
figuratively
sometimes i think she is right, the love is lost
but then i think it is these fucked up circumstances
i really dont want to throw away all of this because of a fucked up schedule
but sometimes it feels like she isnt helping
and then she says that sometimes she also wants to be taken care of
and not just keep taking care of me
but in this particular case, there is little i can do
i dont know
fuck
fuck
fuck
and here i am talking to a fucked up computer at 3:30 in the night
good thing the net isnt working, else this would be anothe fucked up email in the middle of the night
i should stop these frustration loaded emails
and i should somehow find a way to kill the frustration
which increasingly seems to be gaining the upper hand
or maybe i should just fucking break up
but fuck
but fuck
i dont want to
and look at me, punching away at these keys like a mad man
and i still have that half complete letter and not yet started t-shirt
that i right have no interest in getting done
why
why
why
why the fuck am i so fucked up
fffffffffffffffffffaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
people talk to themselves
when they are like this
and here i am, writing to myself in vim
because i am angry and frustrated
if i continue longer, i might even end up calling her and waking her up
i guess i should simply start studying and forget all of this
maybe i should fucking break up
let her get married to some dumb fuck shit ass 
and be happy
fuck
fuck
fuck
fuck
fffffff
i have no idea why i have this smirk on my face right now
i guess i am smiling at myself
and my inability to do anything
anything useful
fuck
there is no fucking way i am getting through google like this
i am just destroying my life
i am
i so fucking am

i doubt anyone has ever ranted like this in a c++ comment :D
few people would have gotten as crazy as I am right now while having a cpp file open
