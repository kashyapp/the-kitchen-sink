high order bit is set or not?

quark:
mmi: how the phone boots and the first screen that oyu see, memory consumption. 

how to save memory: 
registers, function params, globals, ram/rom choices etc

why move?
looking for long term career, not finding oppotrunity in present company.

1) higest bit is set or not?
do a right shift 
sizeof*8 loop

for(i=0; i=sizeof(num)*8-2; i--){
    num >>= 1;
}
if (num & 1){
    return true;
}

for(i=8*sizeof(num)-1;
    i;
    i--)
{
    num >>= 1;    
}

2) resizable vector

my data structure would be a linked list
only a single type

if user code looks like 
    for(i=0;i<1000000;++i)
        v.push_back(i)

implement push_back

the only way to get O(1) is array //ah, he gets that
to an array, i cannot add memory dynamically

i suggest that you can add 10 at a time


sorry yaar
too many doubts in my mind
O(n^2)

it will be n(log n)
the number of times i need to do the copy operation is log n.

i then told him that initially, more frequent small copies, later less frequent larger copies

n+log(n)
two loops are independent, so i have to add them
this is what i thought.

if you are doing in c, you can use realloc
c++ does not have an equivalent of realloc
