0) my introdcution
0.1) 

1) storage-controller at each base service station (laptops, desktops etc)
user moves from cell to cell

handoff mechanism for mobile devices

2) 

             1
          2     3
        4  5      6
              7

1,2,3,4,5,6 : pre-order

1,2,3,4,5,6,7 : 1,2,4,5,7,3,6


noticed that we are printing level by level
level based proessing
read out 'what' the algo would do, but not what the algo was

foreach node
	process node
	if(left) print left node
	if(right) print right node
	prioritising the left node
		call again the same algo


void print(struct node* root){
	int flag=1;
	struct node *p = root;
	if(p == NULL)
		return;
	else{
	      	if (p->left != NULL && flag){
			print p->left;
			flag=0;
		}
		if (p->right != NULL && flag){
			print p->right;
			flag=0;
		}
		print(node->left);
		print(node->right);
	}
}

//as he walked through, he realised this won't work when he got to 5->7
//
//i think we need to use a datastructure called stack
//as and wen i encounter a node, push it onto the stack, and push the left and right also onto the stakc
//
