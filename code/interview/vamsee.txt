0) What is amazon ?
0.1) Why amazon?

1) Strongest points
--> elicitation of requirements, tell whether specs are clear or not, ability
--> decent coding skills
--> sees the big picture

2) Skills
--> C/C++ and then Java

3) Unix
--> C++/SOlaris env for last two years
shell script, takes each log file, and finds number of errors
grep ERROR|wc -l for a single file

dir is commandline arg:


#!/bin/bash
$myprdir=`pwd`
cd $1
$list=`ls`
for i in $list #whitespace delimiter
do
	$count=`grep ERROR $i|wc -l`
	echo $count
done

#what if dir of days
#check whether file or dir, and proceed as above.


4) OO
* pure virtual function: interface and no impl, dervied class HAS to implement it.
* 	runtime polymorphism
* 	virtual function: else abstract class
* private and public inheritance diff:
* 	private inheritance for reuse, not for interface
* 	books catalog privately inherit list class, but clients need not know how it is implemented. so derive privately.

//this is breadth first traversal.
//using a queue, enqueue all a node's children
//until q gets empty, deque and continue as above.
//

--> print each level alternately
use one q and one stack
number the levels
normal dir go into q, reverse goes into stack

//use a deque, 
*/

//two stacks and number the level

when you are popping from one q, push children into the other q
