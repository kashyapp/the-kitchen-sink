2nd largest
heapify the array, first max, move it the end, 

a heap is an almost complete binary tree

first heapify, then remove the top element by swapping it with the last, decrement array size by 1 and then correct the heap property by starting at the top.


selection algorithms usually use heaps

20 largest elements
worked it out with minor hinting

1) log files. gzipped, hidden in dirs, find all log files with errors in them.


2) pure virtual
abstract class

3) 

stack S;
current = root;

while(1){
 	while(current->left!=NULL){
		push current;
		current = current->left;
	}
	print current;
	if(current->right!=NULL){
		current = current->right;
	}
	else if(s.not empty){
		current = pop;
		print current;
		
	}
	else 
		break;
}
