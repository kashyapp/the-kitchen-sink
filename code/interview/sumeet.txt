0) microsoft and earlier game project

1) given input of n ints, return array of products of ints where kth position does not include kth element in the product

eg: 1 2 3 4 5
2.3.4.5, 1.3.4.5, 1.2.4.5, 1.2.3.5, 1.2.3.4

2)

class node{
public:
int value;
node * pnext;

public: node(){
	pnext = NULL;
}

};


node* reverseList (node *phead){
	if(phead  == NULL)
		return NULL;
	node *previous=NULL;
	while(phead){
		node *tmp;
		tmp  = phead->pnext;
		phead->pnext = previous;
		previous = phead;
		phead = tmp;
	}
	return phead;
}
