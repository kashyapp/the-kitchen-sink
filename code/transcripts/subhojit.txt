interesting project:
haar transform, wavelet
image compression
wavelet coding

resizing the internal array 
constant time array resize


-------------------------------
N+1 size array
filled with numbers from 1 to N-1
find the first duplicate

sort and look at adjacent elements
this is o(n log n)

N+1=6
take hypothetical case where array is sorted

i give up
