Working at Netapp, data replication, Bangalore
want to move to Hyderabad, home town, family
Netapp through placements

What you expect from Amazon?
good development environment, work culture
adaptable to any sort

interests? dbms, os and somewhat algorithms

any one paper:
icip paper: recent one, title "Basic video surveillance"
transferable belief model, contribution was parallelism, 40x speedup

goal of the overall system: automate the application, speed was not okay, detect the object before it leaves the scene, use cluster computing
PS3 engine multi-core

what needs to change in code to change from uni-core to multi-core, two cores are ppc and 8 are spe cores.ibm simulator, install on vmdk, run on vmware the 10 core system

you need to do the dma stuff also yourself. addressable space was 256kb for the smaller core
=============================================================
maybe C++
some c++ programs

realloc
increase it by some number 5 or 10

when using realloc, compilaer takes care, cost of realloc 
overall complexity is O(n^2)

chain the arrays, :)

"study the incoming data
suddenly have a big burst, does k,2k,4k work???"

it should be somewhat linear
----------------------------------------------------------------
(1(2(3)(4))(5)(6(7)))
give me code to reconstruct
use a stack or queue

node{
data;
* child;
* sibling;
};

when i get a close bracket, something soemthing

void addelement(int a, int top){
    int flag = 0;
    node *t, *t1;
    t=root;
    t1=root;
    while(flag != 1){
        if(top ==  t->data && t!=null){
            node *ptr = makenode();
            ptr->data = a;
            if(t->child != null){
                while(t->sibling != null){
                    t = t->sib;
                }
                t->sib = ptr;
            }
        }
        else if(searchsib(t,data) != null){
        }
    }
}

node* gee(char *str){
    int i=0;
    while(str[i]!null){
        if(i==0 && str[i+1]=='('){
            push(str[i]);
            node *n = createNode();
            n->data=atoi(str[i]);
        }
        if(str[i++]=='('){
            push(str[i]);
            addelement(str[i],top());
        }
    }
}
